# HackerRankChallenges 🧠💻
A set of HackerRank Challenges I use to improve my coding skills

# Run the code ⚙️
## Python 🐍
Python Challenges are executed by: python3 myProgram, where myProgram is the name of the program.

## C 🧑🏻‍💻
C Challenges are executed by :

 1. gcc -o name myProgram.c 
 2. ./name

Where name is the name the executable receives and myProgram.c is the name of the program that we are trying to run.
