# Coding Challenges 🧠💻

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode-style coding challenges! This is where I practice and refine my problem-solving skills across different programming languages.

## 🚀 Getting Started
This repository contains coding challenges implemented in multiple languages. Below are the instructions to run the solutions.

### 🐍 Running Python Challenges
To execute a Python solution, use the following command:
```sh
python3 myProgram.py
```
Replace `myProgram.py` with the actual filename of the challenge you want to run.

### 💻 Running C Challenges
To compile and run a C solution, follow these steps:

1. Compile the program using `gcc`:
   ```sh
   gcc -o name myProgram.c
   ```
   - Replace `name` with the desired name for the executable.
   - Replace `myProgram.c` with the filename of the challenge.

2. Execute the compiled program:
   ```sh
   ./name
   ```

## 📌 Notes
- These challenges are meant for self-improvement and practice.
- Feel free to contribute by adding new challenges or optimizing existing solutions.
- Feedback and discussions are always welcome!

Happy coding! 🚀
