# plusMinus

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with **6**  places after the decimal.

**Note**: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up $$10^{-4}$$ to  are acceptable.

## Example
With the input:
$$arr=[1, 1, 0, -1, -1]$$

the output must be:
$$0.400000$$
$$0.400000$$
$$0.200000$$
